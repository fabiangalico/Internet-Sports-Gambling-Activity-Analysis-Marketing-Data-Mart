# Internet-Sports-Gambling-Activity-Analysis-Marketing-Data-Mart
## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to explore an online gambling website dataset for the period February - September
2005, creating an interactive shiny app to get marketing insights. Firstly, we created a basetable with one
row per customer and different metrics; for example, the sum and mean amount of money each customer bet
or how many days the customers have been active in the website and the frequency. Secondly, we created
a shiny app where the user can filter by different metrics and explore various marketing insights from the
different plots by themselves.
