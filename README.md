# Internet-Sports-Gambling-Activity-Analysis-Marketing-Data-Mart

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to explore an online gambling website dataset for the period February - September
2005, creating an interactive shiny app to get marketing insights. Firstly, we created a basetable with one
row per customer and different metrics; for example, the sum and mean amount of money each customer bet
or how many days the customers have been active in the website and the frequency. Secondly, we created
a shiny app where the user can filter by different metrics and explore various marketing insights from the
different plots by themselves.

## Suggestions

The goal of the project was to create a datamart and build an interactive shiny app. There is still room for
further improvement in different aspects. Firstly, it would be useful to have a function to group by directly in
the Shiny app. Secondly, the user interface and plots were kept simple and clean. The main reason was to
make faster loading time for plots, as with other packages, such as Plotly is taking too much time to render
the interactive plots online. Finally, the basetable created in the project can be used to build a prediction
model in the future along with insights gained from the Shiny dashboard for variable selection process.
